# Installing the mod

## Manually

_I recommend using a mod manager like [r2modman](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/ebkr/r2modman/)._

To install the mod manually you first need to click on the **[Manual download](https://https://thunderstore.io/package/download/AMRV/ConfigurableCompany/1.1.0/)** button.

Once downloaded you will have a zip containing some files. As this is a plugin that depends on BepInEx you need to place the extracted zip inside the `plugins` located under the `BepInEx` folder. If you are unable to locate said folder you might need to [install BepInEx](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/BepInEx/BepInExPack/).

After extracting the file in the corresponding folder you might start the game and the mod should load correctly.

## Using a mod manager

_The guide uses [r2modman](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/ebkr/r2modman/) as mod manager._

First select a game profile (or the default one if you prefeer).

Now you will see four important buttons, `start modded`; `start vanilla`; `installed` and `online`. Go ahead and click `online`.

Search for this mod and click **download**. Now the mod should appear at the `installed` panel.
