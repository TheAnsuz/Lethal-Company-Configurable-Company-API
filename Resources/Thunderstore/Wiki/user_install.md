# User Install

This small guide will help you adding the mod to your game.

> **TIP**  
> Use a mod manager to install mods & dependencies easily

## Using a mod manager

Just search for the name **ConfigurableCompany** and click `Download`.  
If you want the content make sure to install **LethalCompanyVariables**.

_Keep in mind the mod requires BepInEx._

## Manually

For the manual install you need [BepInEx for lethal company](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/BepInEx/BepInExPack/). The mod page contains a guide on how to setup BepInEx, I recommend to also check it out.

Go to the [version's tab](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/AMRV/ConfigurableCompany/versions/) and select the latest version (the top one). Click `Download` and place the mod inside your plugins folder (...BepInEx\plugins\\...). Extract the ZIP file and done!

_Keep in mind this mod is only the source, if you want the content you need to repeat the previous steps with [Lethal Company Variables](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/AMRV/LethalCompanyVariables/) or any other mod that uses this one._
