# ConfigurableCompany

_This is an API, does not contain configurations itself, only the tools for other developers to implement their own._

This is `BepinEx` Plugin that allows the developer to create configurations that will be displayed in-game so the user can modify them freely.

## How it works

If any configuration is created, a menu will appear alongside the file selection menu where the user will be able to modify some values to customize their game.

The configurations do save between matches so no need to modify them every time you start the same game. Also configurations are file-dependant so you can have different values on each save slot.

For example you can have a x10 enemy spawn multiplier for your first game slot and in the second game slot have a x0 enemy spawn multiplier.
