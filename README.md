_A robust and powerful API for configuration handling and synchronization in real time. Create file-dependant configurations that can be changed while in game by the players._

## What Is Configurable Company

Configurable company is a BepInEx plugin that allows developers to create their own configurations for the game. These are different from other configurations because they are individually managed for each save file slot.
